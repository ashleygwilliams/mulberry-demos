## Preparation

1. Bring a large pot of salted water (sea water salty!) to a boil.
2. Add penne and cook until al dente.
3. Meanwhile, melt butter in a saucepan over medium-high heat. Cook garlic and onions until onions have softened. Add flour and cook 1 to 2 minutes, stirring constantly. Season with salt and pepper.
4. Stir in broth, stirring frequently until sauce comes to simmer. Remove from heat.
5. Using an immersion hand blender blend until sauce is smooth. Stir in sour cream.
6. Drain pasta, transfer to a large serving bowl, and top with chicken. Pour sauce over pasta, toss in a handful of snow peas and red pepper flakes, and toss well.
