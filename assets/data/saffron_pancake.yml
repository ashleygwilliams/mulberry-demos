ingredients:
  - 'for Kesari Kheer:'
  - 2 litre whole milk
  - 50 grams rice
  - 2 tbsp sugar (you can adjust it to suit your taste)
  - ½ tsp saffron
  - ½ tbsp almonds slivered (soaked over-night in water)
  - ½ tbsp pistachio (chopped)
  - ½ tbsp raisin
  - ½ tbsp cashew nuts (roasted) chopped
  - (using dry fruits is optional)
  - 'for Pooda:'
  - 1 cup whole wheat flour
  - ¾ cup sugar
  - 1 tsp anise seeds/ fennel seeds
  - Water (for the batter)
  - Oil for shallow frying
preparation:
  - 'Wash the rice well.'
  - 'Boil the milk (on high flame) in a thick bottomed wide-mouthed container stirring it continuously so that it does not burn at the bottom.'
  - 'Once it is boiled, lower the heat. Remove 2 tbsp of milk in a small cup and add saffron to it. Let it soak at least for 10-15 minutes.'
  - 'Meanwhile, add washed rice to the boiled milk. Increase the heat again and keep stirring it till the milk starts to boil again.'
  - 'Lower the heat and after 15 minutes add the soaked saffron milk.'
  - 'Let the milk simmer (stirring it occasionally) till it reduced to half the quantity.'
  - 'Turn off the heat and add sugar, cashews, almonds, pistachio and raisins.'
  - 'Serve hot or chill it before serving.'
  - 'Note: Keep aside a tsp of each of the dry fruits to garnish on the top while serving.'
  - '(The kheer will take approximately 45 - 50 minutes to cook)'
  - 'Making Poodas: Mix all the ingredients, except water. Bring them all together by gradually mixing in the water. The consistency should not be thin but of a pouring consistency.'
  - 'Heat a tawa (skillet) and pour 2 tsp oil. Pour a 2 tbsp of batter over the heated oil. Spread it to a round shape but do not make it very thin. Cook it on medium-low heat. Once the top is done, flip it to cook the other side. If the oil seems less, pour a little bit around the edges.'
  - 'This batter should yield almost 8 poodas.'
