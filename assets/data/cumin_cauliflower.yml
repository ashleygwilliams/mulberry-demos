type: recipe
ingredients:
  - 1 head of cauliflower, your choice of color
  - 1 Tbsp ground cumin
  - 3 Tbsp extra virgin olive oil
  - 1/2 tsp Kosher salt (or to taste)
  - Chives to garnish
preparation:
  - 'Preheat oven to 400 F'
  - 'Remove the thick green leaves from your cauliflower and cut into tiny florets. I usually make my florets or slices 1-inch long and 1/4-inch thick.'
  - 'Place cauliflower in a baking or casserole dish. Sprinkle with cumin and shake or stir to coat the cauliflower.'
  - 'Drizzle with olive oil, season with salt and bake for 25-30 minutes or until the cauliflower is tender and edges are beginning to turn golden brown. I tend to "overcook" mine until the cauliflower is super crispy, but it is completely up to you!'
  - 'Serve warm with a sprinkle of freshly minced chives.'
