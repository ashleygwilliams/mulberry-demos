ingredients:
  - 'for filling:'
  - 'about 400 g Jicama / Yam Bean'
  - 'about 100 g carrots'
  - '2 tbs dried shrimps'
  - '5 large garlic cloves, chopped'
  - '1 tbs oyster sauce'
  - '2 tbs light soy sauce'
  - '1 tbs sugar'
  - '1/2 cup water'
  - 'oil for frying'
  - 'for skin:'
  - '165 g wheat starch'
  - '85 g tapioca flour'
  - '420 g hot boiling water'
  - '3 - 5 tbs oil (I used 3 tbs)'
preparation:
  - 'For the filling: Rinse and soak dried shrimps until soft. (About 20 mins)'
  - 'Peel and shred or finely julienne yam bean and carrots into about 3" long strips.'
  - 'Drain soaked shrimps and squeeze out water. Chop coarsely.'
  - 'Heat a little oil and saute the garlic and shrimp until fragrant.'
  - 'Stir in both veges until slightly cooked.'
  - 'Add in oyster sauce, light soy sauce, sugar and water.'
  - 'Stir to coat evenly.'
  - 'Lower heat, cover and simmer. Give it a stir every now and then. Check often to see if you need to add more water.'
  - 'Cook until vege is soft and translucent but still holding its shape (not too mushy).'
  - 'Season to taste with salt and pepper.'
  - 'Turn off heat and leave to cool.'
  - 'For the Skin: Combine wheat starch and tapioca flour in a large, heatproof mixing bowl.'
  - 'Stir in boiling water until you get an almost translucent dough. *Note: This was tough to do as the dough was very sticky and firm so I gave up and transferred to my Kenwood Chef mixer with a dough hook to mix and knead.'
  - 'Once you get a nice translucent dough, cover and leave to rest for about 10 mins.'
  - 'Add in the oil 1 tbs at a time and knead well after each addition. Keep at it until all 3 tbs oil are used up.'
  - 'Remove from bowl and shape into a long log and divide into about 30 - 35 pieces, depending on how big you want your dumplings to be.'
  - 'Prepare the steamer.'
  - 'Oil the base of your steaming tray. (Some people use parchment paper)'
  - 'Roll out the little balls of dough into circles about 3" in diameter.'
  - 'Work quickly or the skin will dry up and become too brittle to wrap or cover with a damp cloth in between.'
  - 'Spoon a good tbs of jicama filling into the center of the skin.'
  - 'Bring the two ends together, pleat and pinch to seal.'
  - 'Arrange the dumplings onto well-oiled steaming tray and steam for 15 - 18 mins or until skin is translucent.'
  - 'Serve warm with chili sauce.'
  - 'Dumplings can be kept in the freezer uncooked.'
  - 'Place frozen dumplings directly into steamer and steam for about 15 - 18 mins or until translucent.'
  - 'Remember to oil the tray your dumplings sit on or use parchment paper to line.'
