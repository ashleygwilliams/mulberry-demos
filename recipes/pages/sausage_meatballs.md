This recipe was passed down from my Mom, she had been making it as long as I can remember! Her sauce is kept light with the addition of crushed tomatoes and seasoned by the rich flavor of the Italian sausage. The homemade meatballs are inspired from a favorite meatloaf recipe which uses a combination of ground beef and ground pork... delicious.
