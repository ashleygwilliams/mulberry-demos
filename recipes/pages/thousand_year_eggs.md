ingredients:
  - "for the Eggs:"
  - "2 c Tea, very strong black"
  - "1/3 c Salt"
  - "2 c Ashes of pine wood"
  - "2 c Ashes of charcoal"
  - "2 c Fireplace ashes"
  - "1 c Gardening Lime (available at nurseries or garden supply stores)"
  - "12 Duck eggs, fresh"
  - "for the Dipping Sauce:"
  - "2 tablespoons vinegar"
  - "2 tablespoons soy sauce"
  - "2 tablespoons rice wine"
  - "1 tablespoon minced fresh ginger"
preparation:
  - "Combine tea, salt, ashes and lime. Using about 1/2 cup per egg, thickly coat each egg completely with the clay-like mixture."
  - "Line a large pot, such as a garden pot, with garden soil and carefully lay coated eggs on top. Cover with more soil and place pot in a cool dark place. Allow to cure for 100 days."
  - "To remove coating, scrape eggs and rinse under running water to clean thoroughly. Crack lightly and remove shells. The whites of the egg will appear a grayish, translucent color and have a gelatinous texture. When sliced, the yolk will be a grayish-green color."
  - "To serve, cut into wedges and serve with sweet pickled green onions or sweet pickled vegetables and the dipping sauce."

These Chinese delicacies are often called thousand-year eggs, even though the preserving process takes only 100 days. They can also be purchased in Asian markets.
