Parmesan crisps, or _frico_ as they are known in Italy, are a delicious and beautiful garnish to dishes such as risotto, pasta, salads, etc. While they are still warm, you can also press them into a muffin tin to make miniature edible bowls - perfect for hors d'oeuvres. Add your favorite herb(s) for additional flavor.
