Cauliflower always gets such a bad rap as a bland, boring white food -- and honestly, if you served it simply boiled or steamed, this isn't far from the truth. The key to cooking with cauliflower is knowing which flavors to pair with it! Cumin and cauliflower were simply made for each other! Cumin has a warm aroma and nutty, almost peppery flavor, which pairs well with cauliflower's naturally nutty and vegetal flavor -- a flavor similar to very mild broccoli. Roasting is my preferred method for cooking cauliflower -- the florets are cooked until tender while the edges turn a golden brown and become quite crisp! 

Cauliflower, for being a white food, is also surprisingly high in nutritional value! Packed with dietary fiber, low in carbohydrates and a good source of folate (folic acid/vitamin B9) and vitamin C.
